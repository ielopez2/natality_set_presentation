# natality_set_presentation

This project is for STAT 448: Advanced Data Analysis

I will be exploring the CDC 2015 US Natality Data set. Data wrangling and data visuals will be created using SAS.
Markdown will be used through Jupyter Notebooks. 

Questions we will be exploring along the way
● Do mothers with any risk factors tend to have complications during labor?
● How early do mothers with knowledge of having risk factors receive prenatal
care?
● Should there be more emphasis on starting prenatal care early among risk
factored pregnant mothers?
